In this assignment I implemented logistic regression as well as an analysis of its accuracy via true positive rate and false positive rate to create a ROC curve and then to finally calculate the area under the curve to determine the accuracy of the model.

| Threshold | Mean FPR | Mean TPR |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| 0.0000    | 1.0000   | 1.0000   |
| 0.1000    | 0.0526   | 0.9974   |
| 0.2000    | 0.0295   | 0.9949   |
| 0.3000    | 0.0211   | 0.9927   |
| 0.4000    | 0.0153   | 0.9905   |
| 0.5000    | 0.0112   | 0.9877   |
| 0.6000    | 0.0090   | 0.9839   |
| 0.7000    | 0.0067   | 0.9786   |
| 0.8000    | 0.0042   | 0.9700   |
| 0.9000    | 0.0023   | 0.9524   |


Average Area Under Curve: 0.9971
